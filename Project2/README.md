To test, simply open *project2.py*, change the test path argument (line 138) to the relative path of the test folder, and run the python file. The printed output should show the prediction for each test txt file along with a second choice and third choice.

In addition to the python script, the model folder contains the centroid information, means, and standard deviations for each column in the dataset (c, m, s numpy files), and then a dictionary with A, B, pi matrices for each class is stored in model.pkl.
