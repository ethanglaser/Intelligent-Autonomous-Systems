## Checkpoint

The current code setup is not flexible to unseen inputs (that will change by the final submission deadline). Run line 112, 113, or 114 to display the map for 20/21/23. The results are also saved in the results folder.


## Final

Update line 442 to match the relative location of the data folder to the python script. Then update line 445 to input the number associated with the files (ie Encoders20.mat would be 20, etc.). Then run the file and the result will be output to the results folder as a png with name output20 or whatever number.
