# Intelligent Autonomous Systems

This repository contains code and results from all 4 projects from ECE 5242 at Cornell Tech.

## Project 1 - Red Barrel Color Segmentation

Project 1 focuses on identifying the pixels in an image belonging to a red barrel(s) using Gaussian Mixture Models and then using the segmenation to identify how far from the camera the barrel is situated.

## Project 2 - Gesture Recognition

Project 2 classifies accelerometer/gyroscope readings to a set of several patterns of motion using Hidden Markov Models and Baum-Welch.

## Project 3 - SLAM

Project 3 uses a combination of robot wheel encodings and LIDAR sensor readings to map a robot's path through an environment and determine the location of open space and walls using SLAM.

## Project 4 - Reinforcement Learning

Project 4 focuses on utilizing reinforcement learning to tackle various tasks using OpenAI Gym environments (Frozen Lake, Mountain Car, Acrobot) specifically using value and policy evaluation/iteration and Q Learning.
